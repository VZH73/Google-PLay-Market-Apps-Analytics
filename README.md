# Google-PLay-Market-Apps-Analytics
Project Done In Partial Fulfilment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics

The aim of this project was to make a research into the Google Play Market apps ecosystem and try to figure out what affects apps popularity, how to reach monetary success with new app development and avoid risk of popularity decrease. Working on this project it was essential to demonstrate tools and techniques for processing the huge amount of data that Google Play Market has to offer. Number of available apps there is close to 3 million and many thousands new apps are added every day. So, in order to be as precise as possible and answer really focused questions, it is important to have reliable and scalable tools that could effectively utilize available computational power. 
During this project there were offered several different approaches from technical point of view. They are:
Web Scrapping
Data Optimization
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for user reviews
Visual Image Comparison for similarity with deep learning
These approaches were created to be scalable, utilizing available resources from GPU and CPU, being memory and storage effective. 
As a result, all these areas of research were covered and quite a lot of conclusions were made based on processed data. There were identified most popular app groups, apps that bring most value and which audience they are targeted to. There was developed a way to tell if the app is losing popularity or not â€“ the feature that is not straightforward to tell, only after processing of billions of user reviews it was possible to figure it out. Also, after processing of reviews it became more evident if app star rating is a fake or quite corresponds to the sentiment of the review. Finally, it was shown that different apps could gain some popularity by mimicking each other visual appearance. 
In conclusion, although that the total amount of computer hours that were collectively spent on this project is close to 2-3 months of 24/7 of a very powerful workstation, the scope of the whole play market is about 30 times bigger and to be able to process everything, much more precise questions must be asked. With the provided tools and approaches it became much easier now to head into every possible direction for deeper, wider and further investigations.
